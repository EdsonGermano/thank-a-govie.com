  <p>At <a href="http://www.socrata.com">Socrata</a>, we love our hard-working, forward-thinking, passionate customers.</p>

  <p>They truly are changing the way governments interact with their citizens, increasing public trust, and building the framework for the next generation of government. They're putting in the extra hours, taking risks, and pushing their organizations to change because they believe it's the right thing to do.</p>
